First, I made a link from there to here, using $PWD (important!) - to avoid
accidentally creating too many levels of symbolic links due to the relative
paths:

$ ln -s $PWD/loop-convert/ ~/sandbox/clang-llvm/llvm/tools/clang/tools/extra/loop-convert

I ran this in $HOME/clang-llvm/llvm/tools/clang/, to add loop-convert to the 'ninja' via 'cmake':

$ echo 'add_subdirectory(loop-convert)' >> tools/extra/CMakeLists.txt

To compile, go to ~/sandbox/clang-llvm/build and run 'ninja'
Or in one command:

$ ninja -C ~/sandbox/clang-llvm/build

To test:

$ ninja -C ~/sandbox/clang-llvm/build && ~/sandbox/clang-llvm/build/bin/loop-convert logger-test.cpp -- --std=c++11
